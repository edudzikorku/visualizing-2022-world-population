# Description:

## World Population Visualization

Explore the dynamic visualization of the world's population as of 2022 in this interactive and informative project. Leveraging the power of the Plotly library,the work presents the global population data as of 2022.

### Overview:

The project fetches population data through the World Bank API and employs Python's Plotly library to create an interactive sunburst plot. The plot allows users to navigate through different regions, countries, and population figures with ease. Hover over each section to reveal precise population values, enabling an engaging exploration of global demographics.

### Features:

- Interactive Sunburst Plot: The sunburst plot dynamically displays population data, providing an intuitive visualization of population distribution across continents and countries.

- Informative Hover Text: Hover over regions and countries to access detailed population figures, aiding in a deeper understanding of demographic trends.

### How to Use:
